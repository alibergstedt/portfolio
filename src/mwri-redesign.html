                        <div>
                          <p>
                            When I approach a project, especially one as large as a complete ecommerce
                            website redesign, research and questions are important.  
                            I first like to meet with clients, ask questions, do market research, analyze the 
                            competitors, and get user feedback.  This is vital in defining what our ultimate
                            goals will be and what problems the design will be solving.
                        </p>

                            For MWRI, the issues were not in the product itself.  The customers raved about the 
                            product and service of the company seen through their many glowing reviews.  The complaints
                            from the company were customer retention (rarely did they see customers coming back for
                            more than one order) and an inconsistent branding experience. After doing additional market analysis 
                            and looking at website traffic analytics, I was able to determine some additional painpoints 
                            that needed solving including the length of their forms and call to action buttons.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The main goals I set out to solve was to create a more cohesive, trustworthy design to solve the
                            problem with credibility.  I also set out to determine how to 
                            increase customer retention.

                            After meetings and discussions with the client, to solve to issue with customer retention, a new website 
                            name was proposed.  My Wedding Reception Ideas was too long and was created in the days of organic SEO 
                            instead of created with memorability in mind.  However, when rebranding a company, a new company name is 
                            a decision that should not be taken lightly. It can
                            affect your search engine rankings and involves a signficant amount of marketing and SEO work.  While I
                            felt this was the best way forward for memorability and longevitiy of the site brand, MWRI decided that was a change
                            they were not ready to make.
                        </p>
                        <p>  
                            Instead we produced a cohesive modern site through color, typography,
                            and iconography that represented a credible and welcoming wedding website.  We chose a color scheme
                            that was both muted and soft yet bold in our call to action colors.  For our display fonts, we chose
                            a romantic serif font.  Both catered to our gender and age demographic. 
                        </p>
                        </div>
                      </div>
                      <div class="project-wrapper__image load-hidden"
                        style="margin: 5em auto;">
                          <div
                          class="thumbnail rounded"
                        >
                          <img
                            alt="Project Image"
                            class="img-fluid"
                            src="assets/mwri/new-home-full.jpg"
                          />
                        </div>
                      </div>
                      <div class="project-wrapper__text load-hidden">
                        <div>
                          <p>
                            Additionally I did a comprehensive analysis of the site and determined how many different
                            button colors, font styles, and variations existed in the design.  We worked to ensure the new design
                            stayed under a total of three font styles and stuck to a consistently branded color scheme and theme.  This 
                            was imperative for creating a more trustworthy and credible website experience.
                          </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                              Another change that was made was to the product pages.  This page 
                              was very personalization with many different form fields.  We simplified the screen by 
                              enlarging the product image, removing 
                              unecessary buttons, bringing consistency through color and 
                              typogrphy, and bringing focus to the ultimate goal of conversion.
                            </p>
                          </div>

                      <div class="project-wrapper__image load-hidden"
